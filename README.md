## Foundation

Next.js App Router, TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, React Icons, PostgreSQL, Docker Compose, PWA manifest, conservative offline shell, Dexie/outbox starter, health endpoint, unit-test scaffold and CI. English interface.

The service worker caches only the public shell and versioned static files. It does not cache API responses or private data. Product workflows, accounts and data sync are still planned.
