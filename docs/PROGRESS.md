# Progress log

## 2026-10-27 — foundation

**Done:** localized Next/TypeScript/Tailwind/React Icons/PostgreSQL/Docker/PWA shell, Dexie/outbox starter, health route, metadata test, CI, product brief, task/backlog and operations/security notes.

**Not done:** product workflow, auth, domain tables, sync, release security review, provider, dependency install and lockfile.

**Next:** Import monthly meter use and show transparent comparison.

**Blocker:** GitHub returned “You have created too many repositories, too quickly. Please try again later” after the first public repositories. This project remains committed locally with its intended origin.


## Environment check — 2026-10-27

**Update:** Compose now passes PostgreSQL host, database, user and password as separate environment fields so local password characters do not break a connection URL. docker compose config --quiet passes for all 30 projects; runtime verification is pending Docker access.

Docker service com.docker.service is stopped; Start-Service cannot open it with current permissions. The npm cache registry at localhost:4873 is unavailable. Offline lockfile generation returned ETARGET for eslint-config-next@16.4.3 from the host cache. No dependency install, tests or production build ran; CI reports a warning and skips dependency installation, tests, lint and build until a lockfile is committed.
